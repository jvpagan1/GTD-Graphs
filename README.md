## The Effect of COVID-19 on Regions at War or with High Levels of Social Unrest (R-Language)

This [website](https://jvpagan1.github.io/The-Effect-of-COVID-19-On-Regions-at-War-or-With-High-Levels-of-Social-Unrest/) compares (i) global terrorism by year for the world vs. Iraq (Graph 1), (ii) global terrorism attacks by country since 1970 for the 10 top countires (Grpahs 2-4), (iii) a regression analysis of terrorist attack vs. COVID-19 cases and deaths (Graph 5), (iv) terrorist attacks vs. COVID-19 deaths per capita by country (Graph 6), and (v) terrorist attacks vs COVID-19 deaths per captia (Graphs 7-9).  The data was sourced from the Global Terrorism Database and the European Centre for Disease Prevention and Control COVID-19 Database.  The website was built with R-Studio using R-Language.

## Preliminary Findings

As seen in Graph 5, no direct correlation was found between terrorist attacks and COVID-19.  However, countries at war or with high levels of social unrest are clearly outlyers.  See Graph 9.  Yemen exhibits an extemely high COVID-19 mortality, possibly related to poor living and sanitary conditions resulting from its 6 year civil war.  Iraq and Afghanistan exhibit an extremely high number of terrorist attacks, possibly related to the American occupation of these countries over the last 20 years. 

Additional research is needed to validate and elaborate on these findings.
